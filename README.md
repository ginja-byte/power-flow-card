Animated Lovelace card showing real-time energy flow between solar, battery, grid, optional generator, the house, and up to three downstream load separators (pool, geyser, EV charger, etc.). Supports single-phase and three-phase grid setups.

## Features

- 🔄 **Animated flow lines** between every node — direction reverses to indicate import vs export, battery charge vs discharge
- 🎨 **Context-aware colors** — load color from percentage, battery color from discharge rate, inverter color from dominant source
- 🌞 **Solar arc** with animated sun position
- 🔋 **Battery ETA** — "FULL IN 1h 24m" / "EMPTY IN 3h 12m" / "AT CUTOFF"
- ⚡ **Grid outage detection** via voltage threshold with pulsing red alert
- 🔌 **Generator support** with fuel level and status indication
- 🧪 **Three-phase grid** — per-phase voltage / current / power detail panel
- 🚿 **Up to three load separators** — show downstream circuits like pool pump, geyser, EV charger separately from total house load
- 📊 **Source contribution ring** around the house icon showing PV/battery/grid/generator mix
- ⚙️ **Visual editor** — no YAML required for basic setup
- 🧩 **Graceful degradation** — missing optional entities don't break the card

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.6 or newer
- HACS installed (or you can install manually — see below)

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS → **Frontend**
2. Top-right menu (⋮) → **Custom repositories**
3. Add `https://github.com/ginja-byte/power-flow-card` with category **Lovelace**
4. Install **Power Flow Card** from the list
5. Hard-refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Manual installation

1. Download `dist/power-flow-card.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/ginja-byte/power-flow-card/releases)
2. Copy it to `<config>/www/power-flow-card.js`
3. In **Settings → Dashboards → ⋮ → Resources → Add resource**:
   - URL: `/local/power-flow-card.js`
   - Type: JavaScript module
4. Hard-refresh your browser

## Adding the card

1. Edit a dashboard → **Add Card** → search "Power Flow Card"
2. The visual editor opens — fill in your entity IDs in each section (Solar, Battery, Grid, Load)
3. Optional sections (Inverter, Generator, separators, three-phase) stay collapsed unless you expand and configure them
4. Click **Save**

Or paste this YAML and adjust:

```yaml
type: custom:power-flow-card
title: Energy
solar:
  power_entity: sensor.pv_power
  energy_today_entity: sensor.pv_energy_today
battery:
  power_entity: sensor.battery_power
  soc_entity: sensor.battery_state_of_charge
  capacity_kwh: 10           # your battery's usable capacity
  min_soc_percent: 20        # your inverter's cutoff
  energy_in_today_entity: sensor.battery_energy_in_today
  energy_out_today_entity: sensor.battery_energy_out_today
grid:
  power_entity: sensor.grid_power
  voltage_entity: sensor.grid_voltage      # used for grid-off detection
  energy_in_today_entity: sensor.grid_energy_in_today
  energy_out_today_entity: sensor.grid_energy_out_today
load:
  power_entity: sensor.load_power
  percentage_entity: sensor.load_percentage   # optional — drives the load color
  energy_today_entity: sensor.load_energy_today
inverter:                                     # optional
  output_source_priority_entity: select.output_source_priority
  charger_source_priority_entity: select.charger_source_priority
```

## Conventions

- **Power entities are in watts** (positive = into the node, negative = out of it for battery and grid).
- **Battery power**: positive = charging, negative = discharging.
- **Grid power**: positive = importing from grid, negative = exporting.
- **Energy entities are in kWh** and accumulate over the day, typically resetting at midnight (the card just displays the current value).

If your sensors are in kW or your sign conventions are opposite, create template sensors first to convert.

## Optional features

### Disabling solar (battery + grid only setups)

If you don't have solar, set `solar.enabled: false`. The solar node, solar arc, solar→inverter flow line, animated particles, and PV TODAY footer cell are all hidden, and the card is balanced for a battery + grid (or battery + grid + generator) setup.

```yaml
solar:
  enabled: false
```

When enabled (the default), `power_entity` is required. When disabled, the whole `solar:` block can be left empty apart from the `enabled` flag — entities under it are ignored.

### Custom colors

Every color on the card is overridable via the `colors:` section. Provide hex values (e.g. `"#06b6d4"`) for any keys you want to change — anything you omit falls back to the default. Unknown keys are silently ignored, so future versions adding new colors won't break your config.

```yaml
colors:
  solar: "#ffaa00"
  battery_charging: "#22c55e"
  battery_low_dis: "#facc15"
  battery_med_dis: "#fb923c"
  battery_high_dis: "#dc2626"
  grid_import: "#fb923c"
  grid_export: "#22c55e"
  grid_off: "#dc2626"
  load_low: "#22c55e"
  load_med: "#facc15"
  load_high: "#fb923c"
  load_max: "#dc2626"
  generator: "#a855f7"
  idle: "#64748b"
```

The visual editor has color pickers for the 14 most-tweaked keys under **Custom colors (optional)**. Some palette keys (background tones, alert pulse colors, separator-off color) are only overridable via YAML — see the full reference below.

#### Full overridable palette keys

| Key | Default | What it colors |
|---|---|---|
| `solar` | `#fbbf24` | Solar node, solar→inverter flow, sun arc dot |
| `battery_charging` | `#10b981` | Battery node when charging |
| `battery_low_dis` | `#fbbf24` | Battery node, light discharge (≤1 kW) |
| `battery_med_dis` | `#f97316` | Battery node, medium discharge (≤2.5 kW) |
| `battery_high_dis` | `#ef4444` | Battery node, heavy discharge (>2.5 kW) |
| `grid_import` | `#f97316` | Grid node + flow when importing |

### Generator

```yaml
generator:
  enabled: true
  power_entity: sensor.generator_power           # W
  status_entity: binary_sensor.generator_running # optional — if not set, uses power threshold
  fuel_level_entity: sensor.generator_fuel       # optional — 0–100 %
  energy_today_entity: sensor.generator_energy_today
  threshold_w: 50                                # power above this = considered on
```

When enabled, the generator node appears below-left and connects to the inverter via its own animated flow line.

### Three-phase grid

```yaml
grid:
  power_entity: sensor.grid_total_power
  three_phase:
    enabled: true
    phases:
      - label: L1
        power_entity: sensor.l1_power
        voltage_entity: sensor.l1_voltage
        current_entity: sensor.l1_current
      - label: L2
        power_entity: sensor.l2_power
        voltage_entity: sensor.l2_voltage
        current_entity: sensor.l2_current
      - label: L3
        power_entity: sensor.l3_power
        voltage_entity: sensor.l3_voltage
        current_entity: sensor.l3_current
```

A per-phase detail panel appears below the main flow. Grid-off detection uses the max voltage across configured phases.

### Load separators

Up to three "downstream" loads that you want to see broken out from the total house load (the values are not subtracted — they're just shown alongside). Common examples: pool pump, geyser, EV charger.

```yaml
load_separators:
  - name: Pool
    power_entity: sensor.pool_pump_power
    icon: pool                    # any mdi icon name without the "mdi:" prefix
    color: "#06b6d4"
    threshold_w: 5
  - name: Geyser
    power_entity: sensor.geyser_power
    icon: water-boiler
    color: "#ef4444"
    threshold_w: 50
  - name: EV
    power_entity: sensor.ev_charger_power
    energy_today_entity: sensor.ev_charger_today
    icon: car-electric
    color: "#a855f7"
    threshold_w: 100
```

A chip row appears under the main flow showing each separator with on/off styling.

### Inverter mode display

If your inverter exposes output and charger source-priority entities (e.g. a Growatt SPF, Voltronic / Axpert, MPP Solar setup), wire them up to show the current modes inside the central inverter box:

```yaml
inverter:
  output_source_priority_entity: select.output_source_priority
  charger_source_priority_entity: select.charger_source_priority
```

The card extracts shorthand from values like `Solar/Battery/Utility (SBU)` → shows `SBU`.

## Sign conventions cheat sheet

If your existing sensors don't match the conventions above, here's the quick fix — define a template sensor in your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      # Flip the sign of battery power so charge is positive
      - name: "Battery Power (signed)"
        unit_of_measurement: "W"
        state: "{{ 0 - (states('sensor.original_battery_power') | float(0)) }}"
```

## Troubleshooting

**Card shows "Loading…" and never appears**
The card hasn't finished loading from your browser cache. Hard-refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) / Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows). Open the browser dev console — the card logs `POWER-FLOW-CARD v…` on load.

**Card shows red error banner**
The config is invalid. The error text tells you what's wrong — usually a missing required entity. Open the visual editor and fill in the highlighted field.

**Sensors show as 0 W / 0 %**
The entity ID is wrong, or the entity is in `unknown` / `unavailable` state. The card treats both as 0 to avoid breaking. Double-check entity IDs in **Developer Tools → States**.

**Animation flickers or is choppy**
Caused by other dashboard cards triggering frequent re-renders. The card re-renders only when its own watched entities change — if you see thrashing, check that you don't have other custom cards on the dashboard that force the whole view to re-render.

**Inverter mode shows "—"**
You haven't configured the inverter section, or the configured entity is unavailable. Both fields are optional — the box just shows a dash when unset.

## Changelog

### v0.2.1
- **Card shrinks when solar is disabled.** Removing the solar node previously left an empty top half — the layout now uses a shorter aspect ratio and repositions grid / load / inverter / battery to fill the available space. No change for solar-enabled setups.

### v0.2.0
- **Solar can be disabled** via `solar.enabled: false` — hides node, arc, flow line, and PV footer cell for battery + grid only setups
- **Customizable colors** via the `colors:` config section, with a visual editor section for the 14 most-tweaked palette keys (the rest are YAML-only)
- Visual editor: solar's `power_entity` is no longer required (only required when solar is enabled)
- Fixed: solar panel SVG sun icon was using a hardcoded hex value instead of the resolved solar color — overriding `solar` now actually recolors the entire solar visual

### v0.1.0
- Initial release: animated flow lines, solar arc, battery ETA, grid outage detection, three-phase support, up to 3 load separators, optional generator, visual editor
